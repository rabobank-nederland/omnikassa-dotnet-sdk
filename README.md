# Rabo Omnikassa .NET SDK

This repository contains the official .NET SDK for [Rabo OmniKassa](https://www.rabobank.nl/omnikassa).

Rabo Omnikassa offers merchants an all-in-one solution to receive payments on your physical and online locations. It includes a dashboard that puts you in full control of your Rabo OmniKassa and all products included in it: Rabo OnlineKassa, payment terminals, Rabo PinBox, Rabo SmartPin, Retourpinnen, Rabo PinTegoed, Rabo Betaalverzoek Plus and payment brands such as: Maestro, V PAY, iDEAL, MasterCard, Visa, PayPal and AfterPay.

The .NET SDK allows .NET developers to integrate their web shop with Rabo OmniKassa to handle online payments. Note that besides using an SDK Rabo OmniKassa also provides other ways to integrate that may require less effort. More information on this topic can be found on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.rabobank.nl/overview/rabo-omnikassa) of Rabobank.

Detailed developer documentation on how to use the .NET SDK as well as contact information can be found in the [SDK manual](https://github.com/rabobank-nederland/omnikassa-sdk-doc/blob/main/README.md).
